# Tensorflow - Android - Transfer-Learning Cats and Dogs TFLite

The repository contains 2 differents parts:

1. The jupyter-notebook that trains the cat and dog model.
2. A copy of the TensorFlow-Android-Example (https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/android) 
that run my model.
I adpted the the app to handle different input sizes in order to run my model.
